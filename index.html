    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a hard working person that is very shy. I do not talk very much but I love to learn. My best performance in
      any venture is the result of encouragment and my determination, Not others speaking down to me. I am elated to be
      here and will do well at this. I also look forward to working with you, my classmates, and getting to know you.
    </p>
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in central CA. However, Show Low is my real home. Sometimes I miss the beach and the food.
      Of course, not enough to move back.</p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>There are many hobbies that capture my full attention and I love then equally. I love to play my guitar and piano
      while singing in the languages of my choice. My preference lies with the Romance Languages like: French, Italian,
      Spanish and Portuguese. Learn to turn all of my favorite recipes in to vegan/plant based is a priority for me. I
      am fascinated with the study of history. Particularly past Governmental Structures including but not limited to
      ancient empires. </p>
    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>Whatever I enjoy and is challeging enough to be interesting. Maybe design software that can take better readings
      of the deepest, darkest depths of the oceans. Or at least design a submarine like captain Nemo.</p>
    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>Show Low, AZ (AKA) The White Mountians</p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>Most of my friends from High School felt they had to get married in order to make it financially. I prefer to be
      self reliate in this aspect. I hope to support my own financial burdens and that of my Grandmother while she is
      alive</p>
